# High-Performance Computing (HPC) & GPU

- [Parallel Tensor Network Quantum Simulator](https://github.com/Umer-Farooq-CS/Q-Tensor)
  - Hybrid MPI/OpenMP with CUDA acceleration; METIS partitioning; scalable beyond 20+ qubits.
  - Tech: C++, CUDA, OpenMP, MPI
- [MNIST Classification (GPU)](https://github.com/Umer-Farooq-CS/MNIST-Classification)
  - ~6× faster inference (Tensor Cores, FP16, shared mem, kernel fusion, streams); profiled with Nsight.
  - Tech: CUDA, Python, Nsight
- [GPU‑Accelerated Canny Edge](https://github.com/Umer-Farooq-CS/Canny-Edge-Detector)
  - Optimized memory access; ~3.5× over CPU.
  - Tech: C++, CUDA
